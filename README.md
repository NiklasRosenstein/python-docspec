# Docspec

Docspec is a JSON object specification for representing API documentation of programming languages. While in
it's current form it is targeting Python APIs, it is intended to be able to represent other programming
languages in the future as well

## What is...?

The reference implementation for reading/writing the JSON format and API for representing API objects in memory.
