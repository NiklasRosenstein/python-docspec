# Docspec

Docspec is a JSON object specification for representing API documentation of
programming languages. While in it's current form it is targeting Python APIs,
it was designed so that it can be extended to cover a more generalized set of
languages in the future.

__Contents__

* `docspec`: Python library to (de-) serialize Docspec JSON data and CLI.
* `docspec-python`: Python library to parse Python source code into Docspec
  compatible JSON data using `lib2to3`.

__Projects using Docspec__

* [Pydoc-Markdown](https://github.com/NiklasRosenstein/pydoc-markdown) &ndash; The original spark for Docspec.
